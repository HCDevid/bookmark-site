$.ajaxSetup({
	crossDomain:true;
});

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true 					#this is required, we use cookies

1. preflight request
	headers:
		HTTP Verb: OPTIONS

		-Request-
		Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT  (because we're going to submit a form)
		Access-Control-Request-Headers: credentials,... (i thought this was where credentials went)
			any others? examine a GET, POST, GET xhr, and POST xhr to find out what should be in them
		
		-Allow-
		Access-Control-Allow-Origin (required): *
		Access-Control-Allow-Methods (required): GET, POST (may need get, but not sure for what since it already loads the bookmarklet without this. maybe test by removing ACH already in Application Controller)
		Access-Control-Allow-Headers (i thought this included credentials)
		Access-Control-Allow-Credentials (optional)

recieve

2. actual request
simple request


steps:

1. setup response headers in ApplicationController

i think it's okay if we accept from any site since we have csrf-protection

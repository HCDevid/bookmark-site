<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h4 style="font-weight:300"><i>Your privacy is critically important to us. At VRepo we have a few fundamental principles:</i></h4>
<ul>
<li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
<li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals</p><br />
<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.</p><br />
<h4>Website Visitors</h4>
<p>Like most website operators, VRepo collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. VRepo’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how VRepo’s visitors use its website. From time to time, VRepo may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
<p>Certain visitors to VRepo’s websites choose to interact with VRepo in ways that require VRepo to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that VRepo gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, VRepo collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with VRepo. VRepo does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p><br />
<h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>
<p>VRepo may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. However, VRepo does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p><br />
<h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
<p>VRepo discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on VRepo’s behalf or to provide services available at VRepo’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using VRepo’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. VRepo will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, VRepo discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when VRepo believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of VRepo, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an VRepo website and have supplied your email address, VRepo may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with VRepo and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our f  eedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. VRepo takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p><br />
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. VRepo uses cookies to help VRepo identify and track visitors, their usage of VRepo website, and their website access preferences. VRepo visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using VRepo’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of VRepo’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p><br />
<h4>Business Transfers</h4>
<p>If VRepo, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that VRepo goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of VRepo may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p><br />
<h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, VRepo may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at VRepo’s sole discretion. VRepo encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p><br />

questions for jesse:
	should i disable all my AJAXy things on 'ajax:beforeSend' and re-enable them on 'ajax:success'
	is it possible to crash/burn things byallowing them to do stuff on multiple tabs?
	question for jesse: does my default-playlist scheme have implications for the has_many through for bookmark_urls?
	motivation: i want to finish this right and not let it go too long bc of the competition

Idea: "shit or get off the can"
	Automate general porn site production
		Pull Database
		RSS Feeds
		Thumbnail Rehosting
	Adding Value
		Filter out porn that looks bad:
			From a crummy user or tag title
			Processing
				Thumbnail Quality
					-Lighting, effective resolution, fuzziness, etc. Things that we'd associate w/ production value
					-Maybe do some unsupervised learning to select features
					-Some reinforcement learning to check features (seeing how well an adjustment lets it reconcile with known things)
					-basic Information
						-kinds of acts, number of actors, location, clothes
					-features that have physical correlates: facial attractiveness/features, bodily features
				-nlp titling
				Audio Garbled
				tool for tracking down pirated porn
					-cut a deal
		Instant reddit thread creation when someone comments
		download utility
		mixin with vrepo

questions for jesse:
	should i disable all my AJAXy things on 'ajax:beforeSend' and re-enable them on 'ajax:success'
	is it possible to crash/burn things byallowing them to do stuff on multiple tabs?
	question for jesse: does my default-playlist scheme have implications for the has_many through for bookmark_urls?
	motivation: i want to finish this right and not let it go too long bc of the competition
